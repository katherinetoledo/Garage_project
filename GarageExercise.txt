Garage Exercise

Pre Project - Set up a new repo AND a new Eclipse project 

1) Create a base class called vehicle with the following criteria:
- Atleast 3 variables (with differing data types) String, int, boolean
- + 1 ID variable
- Constructor
- Getters and setters
- Calculate Bill method(but this will be replaced by the sub vehicle classes)

2) Create three different vehicle classes that extend off of vehicles (Car, Truck etc.)
Each derived class should have the following:
- Atleast 2 more variables specific to the vehicle
- Getters and setters
- Constructor
- Overridden Calculate Bill method, each vehicle type should have a specific way of calculating a bill (Â£50 + for each wheel, times 2 for bad condition etc)
and should return a float for the cost of the repair

3) Using an Arraylist implementation store all of the vehicles in a garage class

4) Garage class should have the following methods:
- Adding a vehicle to the garage
- Removing a vehicle from the garage (By ID, type etc)
- Fixing a vehicle (Running calculate bill and printing the cost)
- Listing all vehicles in the garage
- Clearing all vehicles in the garage

5) With your runner create vehicles of a specific type (car, truck etc) and use these objects to add to the garage
The other garage methods will likely take in an ID or a vehicle type etc


Calculate Bill Example: 

	public float calcBill() {
		
		int totalBill = 0;
		String condition = C;
		
		// For every wheel on the vehicle multiply by 5 and add to the bill
		totalBill += (noOfWheels*5);
		
		if (condition == C) {
			totalBill * 3;
		}

        return totalBill;
	}

    Make as simple or as complex as you like MUST include atleast 1 variable from Vehicle class and atleast 2 from sub vehicle
